# AocElixir

Solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written in Elixir.

## Running locally

Clone the project and `cd` into `aoc_elixir`. Run `mix deps.get`.

From here you can either run `mix test` to run the automated test suite, or `iex -S mix`
to run the project in an `iex` session. In an `iex` session you can invoke functions with
`ModuleName.function_name()`, e.g. `Trebuchet.part_two()`.
